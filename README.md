This repository contains example code and solutions for interviews that focus on relevant skills and knowledge for software engineering. Example code for Java and TypeScript is provided so far, with example refactoring provided in Java.

The purpose of this form of interviews is to test the type of skills detailed in books like Martin Fowler's "Refactoring" and Robert Martin's "Clean Code".

Concepts tested include:

Encapsulation
Polymorphism
Refactoring
Bug Hunting
Code Cleanliness
Object-Oriented Programming and Design
Design Patterns

The way I conduct the interviews is to ask the interviewees to pretend they are conducting a pull request code review and to add comments to the code in a similar manner to how they would in a real code review.
